# SDEV 300 - Secure Software Engineering - Python Web App with Secure Login

The purpose of this lab was to demonstrate knowledge of Web application vulnerabilities, password complexity, logs, and cryptographic algorithms. 

Part I: The purpose is to update a website to include more secure login and registration forms by providing additional
validation on the password check and to include a password update form. The website displays a
log in page upon entry and the user the option to log in or register. If the user registers an account
on the website, the user entered password is checked to see if has the correct length and
complexity and it does not contain commonly used, expected, or compromised values. After
logging in to the website or creating an account, a home page is displayed along with three
workout tabs, a log out button, and a password reset button. If the user selects the password reset
button and resets their password, their entered password is once again validated. 

Part II: Decrypt three messages.

To deploy the website on your local server, download the attached repository, make sure python3 is installed on your computer, and then run the 
command Run command 'FLASK_ENV=development FLASK_APP=app.py python3 -m flask run'
